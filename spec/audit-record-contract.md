## Abstract

This specification defines an **interoperability primitive**: a canonical byte form and an
append-only hash-chain construction that independent implementations produce
identically and any third party can verify, with governance-specific context
carried in registered extensions rather than in the core. What must agree across
implementations is the _bytes_, not the _semantics_ — so the construction is
specified once and referenced by many, each layer's context riding as a registered
extension on top.

The need is concrete: the governance layers around a tool-calling agent (admission
control, runtime security, caller governance) each require decisions to be recorded
in a _tamper-evident_ audit trail, and none defines what such a record is. One makes
the record a `SHOULD` without defining its shape; one states "tamper-proof" as a
compliance consideration with no checkable guarantee; caller-governance layers emit
incompatible shapes. The guarantee is named at every seam and given a shared
definition at none. (Appendix A names the MCP proposals this was first written
against.)

This specification defines one vendor-neutral **audit record contract**: a minimal
protected core; a type-keyed `extensions` mechanism so each layer attaches context
under one integrity construction; a deterministic sorted-key canonical form
(`audit-record-contract/1`, §2.3); an append-only hash chain; a verification
procedure; and a structured attestation manifest for the part that is not
observable in the records themselves.

## Motivation

Audit is the one governance guarantee every layer asserts and none defines.
Across three independent proposals:

1. **Admission.** A host that admits a tool server `SHOULD` append a
   tamper-evident record for every admission decision (ATSA, MCP PR #2809). The
   proposal specifies the admission decision and its trust model; it does not
   define the record's shape or a shared, cross-layer verifiable form for the
   tamper-evident guarantee — the gap this contract fills.
2. **Interception / runtime security.** Compliance considerations require that
   "audit trails are tamper-proof" (MCP PR #2624) — a deployer obligation, not a
   checked property; the proposal's own audit mechanism is non-blocking
   observability.
3. **Caller governance.** Session- and persona-scoped governance layers emit
   per-action decision records, but in shapes that vary by implementation (field
   names, what is integrity-protected, whether the record is append-only at all).

These three emit _differently shaped_ records — caller-governance carries a
declared purpose and delegating principal; runtime-security carries detections,
drift status, and data classes; admission carries the clearance decision. No
single layer's record shape is the universal one. What they share is not
a field set but a **construction**: an append-only, canonically-hashed, chained,
independently-verifiable record. Specifying that construction once — with a
minimal common core and a typed extension point for each layer's context — lets
all three _conformance-anchor to one definition_ without flattening their
differences. Today the tamper-evident guarantee has no shared definition to write a
conformance check against at any layer. Specifying the record and its verification
once gives every layer one definition to reference and one vector set to anchor to,
instead of each re-deriving and re-testing "tamper-evident" alone.

This specification defines that construction once. It does not move the guarantee
into any one layer; it defines an orthogonal record contract that other
specifications reference, and that a layer may upgrade from `SHOULD` to `MUST` at
its own discretion.

## Specification

The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MAY, and
OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

This contract constrains an **audit record** and the **record chain** it belongs
to. It does not constrain the storage technology, the wire protocol used to read
records, or which governance layer authors them. Any implementation that produces
records satisfying §2.1–§2.7 and §2.9 conforms (§2.8 is reserved and out of scope
for v1), regardless of mechanism.

### 2.1 The Audit Record — Protected Core

An audit record is a structured object describing one governed event. Every
conforming record, whatever extensions it carries, MUST contain the following
**core** fields, all of which are integrity-protected (§2.4):

| Field           | Type                                                        | Requirement                                                                                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `event_id`      | opaque unique id                                            | MUST — unique within the chain                                                             |
| `occurred_at`   | RFC 3339 timestamp (UTC, `Z`, millisecond precision — §2.3) | MUST — assigned by the recorder's clock, MUST NOT be settable by the governed caller       |
| `principal_id`  | opaque id                                                   | MUST — the governed identity the event is attributed to                                    |
| `event_type`    | string from a registered vocabulary                         | MUST                                                                                       |
| `tool_name`     | string \| null                                              | MUST be present; null where no target applies                                              |
| `outcome`       | `allowed` \| `denied` \| `deferred` \| `error`              | MUST — the abstract disposition of the event (§2.1.1)                                      |
| `extensions`    | object keyed by registered type id                          | MUST — at least one registered extension (§2.2); at most one entry per type id             |
| `previous_hash` | hash digest \| null                                         | MUST — links to the prior record (§2.4); null only for the first record in a chain segment |
| `event_hash`    | hash digest                                                 | MUST — the integrity digest of this record (§2.4)                                          |

The core is deliberately emitter-neutral: identity, time, principal, the acted-on
target, the disposition, and the chain linkage. Layer-specific accountability
context does not belong in the core; it belongs in the `extensions` object under
a registered type id (§2.2). Implementations MUST ignore unknown **top-level**
fields rather than rejecting a record, to permit forward extension.

#### 2.1.1 The `outcome` disposition enum

`outcome` is a **closed, abstract disposition vocabulary**, not a per-layer status
code. The cross-profile anchor is the terminal/non-terminal axis:

- `allowed` — the governed event proceeded (terminal).
- `denied` — the governed event was refused (terminal).
- `deferred` — the governed event is held pending a further decision
  (non-terminal; e.g. a quarantine hold pending re-approval).
- `error` — the governance evaluation itself failed (terminal; the record SHOULD
  carry diagnostic context in an extension).

Domain-specific dispositions, reason codes, and severities MUST NOT extend this
enum; they live inside the emitting layer's extension data, bound to the base
outcome (an extension supplies decision _evidence_ that informs the core
`outcome`, never a competing outcome — e.g. a quarantine decision that holds the
event maps to `deferred`, a terminal quarantine maps to `denied`). The
classification of an `event_type` or extension field as security-relevant is
registration **prose**, not a record field — keeping it out of the digest.

### 2.2 Registered Extensions

The record contract is extended **only** through registered extensions, never
through new chain constructions. A record carries an `extensions` object — a JSON
object **keyed by registered type id**, each key's value being that extension's
typed data: `extensions: {"<type>": <data>, ...}`. Extension data is canonicalized
into the same preimage as the core (§2.3) and is therefore integrity-protected by
the same chain — there is exactly one chain construction, shared across all
extensions, and the type id is itself a preimage _key_, so an extension's type
cannot be swapped without breaking verification.

Structural rules:

- A conforming record MUST carry **at least one** registered extension (the
  emitting layer's own context) and MAY carry several — e.g. a caller-governance
  record that also carries runtime-security evidence chains both under one digest.
- The keyed-object form makes a duplicate type structurally unrepresentable: at
  most one entry per type id, keys sorted by the same every-level key-sort as the
  rest of the record (§2.3).
- Type ids are **flat names from a curated registry** (the IANA-media-type
  pattern), not a permissionless namespace; reverse-DNS-style ids are not used.
  Type ids and registered field names form a controlled ASCII registry vocabulary
  (§2.3).

An extension registration defines: the type id; its REQUIRED and OPTIONAL data
fields and their types (and any closed value vocabularies); the `event_type`
vocabulary it recognizes (§2.9); and how its decision evidence binds to the core
`outcome` (§2.1.1). A record's data for each declared extension MUST satisfy that
registration's required fields.

This specification registers and fully specifies one extension, records the converged shape
of a second whose normative registration text is contributed by its implementer,
and **names** a third contributed by reference:

- **`caller-governance`** (specified here). REQUIRED: `purpose_declared` (the
  declared purpose/intent captured at event time). OPTIONAL: `session_id`,
  `invoked_by_principal_id` (the delegating principal), `flagged`,
  `sources_touched`, `sensitivity_encountered`, `output_disposition`,
  `human_actor_id`. **All values defined by this profile MUST be JSON strings,
  except `flagged`, which MUST be a JSON boolean; an OPTIONAL field MAY instead
  carry `null` under the presence rule below.** This keeps the body within the
  base record's string/boolean/`null` restriction (§2.3).
  - **Presence of OPTIONAL fields.** An OPTIONAL field that is absent means the
    emitter does not record it; an OPTIONAL field carried as `null` means the
    emitter records it and it had no value for this event. These are distinct
    facts, and an emitter MUST NOT use the two forms interchangeably for the
    same field. (The known-answer records under Conformance carry
    `invoked_by_principal_id: null` — recorded, no delegating principal — and
    omit `sources_touched`.)
  - **`sources_touched` encoding.** When non-null, the value MUST be the
    canonical serialization of a JSON array of strings, at every cardinality
    including a single source — never a bare delimiter-joined list, which
    cannot unambiguously represent a source name containing the delimiter.
    Each element MUST be a well-formed Unicode string (no unpaired surrogate
    code units) that satisfies the §2.3 protected-string rules (well-formedness,
    NFC, U+0020 trim, control-character rejection, length cap) and MUST be
    non-empty;
    elements are then deduplicated and sorted in ascending order of their
    UTF-8 byte sequences (equivalently, Unicode code-point order). The array is
    serialized with no insignificant whitespace, escaping only `"` as `\"` and
    `\` as `\\`, and that serialization is the field's string value. A
    recorded-but-empty set is carried as `null`, never as `"[]"`.
- **`runtime-security`** — converged shape; **normative registration text
  contributed by Maaz (Interlock), the runtime-security implementer** (final text
  2026-06-14; cross-ref PR #2624), who independently reproduced the two-extension
  known-answer digest from the published rule. The `runtime-security` object summarizes a
  runtime policy disposition for the event and composes with other extension
  bodies without interaction. **All values defined by this profile MUST be JSON
  strings** (no numeric, boolean, `null`, array, or nested-object values), keeping
  the body within the base record's string-only canonicalization and outside any
  number-canonicalization concern (a profile convention, not a core rule — §2.3).
  Fields:
  - `drift_status` (REQUIRED, string enum) — the runtime's evidentiary state
    regarding tool-surface drift: `none` (no drift relative to the approved
    surface evidenced), `observed` (a change evidenced, without a determination
    that it is policy-relevant), `confirmed` (a policy-relevant change evidenced).
    A consumer that does not recognize a value MUST treat the field as absent (no
    claim made), not infer a default.
  - `severity` (REQUIRED, string enum) — `info` | `low` | `medium` | `high`, in
    non-decreasing order of severity. Numeric scores are out of scope for this
    extension and MUST NOT be carried in the canonical body.
  - `quarantine_decision` (REQUIRED, string enum) — the disposition the runtime
    applied: `release` (permitted to proceed), `hold` (held pending review),
    `quarantine`.
  - `policy_id` (REQUIRED, string) — identifies the policy that produced the
    disposition, of the form `<scope>/<name>@<revision>`, where `<scope>` is an
    emitter-qualified namespace (e.g. a reverse-DNS name, a URN, or a registered
    prefix) sufficient to disambiguate the policy across emitters. It is
    vendor-neutral: it names a policy, not a product, an engine, or a detection
    method (e.g. `example.org/runtime-drift@3`).
  - `evidence_hash` (OPTIONAL, string) — when present, a cryptographic digest
    expressed as `<algorithm>:<hex>` (e.g. `sha256:<hex>`) committing to an
    out-of-band evidence record. It is an opaque commitment only: this contract
    does not inline the evidence, prescribe its schema, or require any particular
    detection method, and the base record commits to it as opaque bytes without
    verifying it; a consumer wishing to rely on the evidence resolves and verifies
    it out of band. OPTIONAL because a `drift_status: none` event may have nothing
    to commit to.

  **Outcome binding (§2.1.1):** the disposition is decision _evidence_ informing
  the base `outcome`, never a competing or independent outcome field; the base
  `outcome` MUST reflect the actual enforcement result. A confirmed drift with
  `quarantine_decision: quarantine` held pending review maps to `outcome:
deferred` (as in the `/2` conformance fixture); a terminally-blocked disposition
  maps to `outcome: denied`. Other combinations follow the base record's outcome
  semantics. (This prevents a record whose base outcome is `allowed` from
  simultaneously carrying a `quarantine` disposition: the extension explains
  _why_; the base outcome states _what happened_.)

- **`admission-control`** (named; field set contributed — the clearance decision
  and its inputs). Registered by reference: the Attested Tool-Server Admission
  proposal (ATSA, MCP PR #2809) carries the registration in its own text. As of
  2026-09-30, `enclawed/omcp` also publishes an ATSA text that it marks Final
  (extension version 1.0), with the same `admission-control` profile; PR #2809
  remains the registration's origin, and neither that text's change to the
  attestation document's `v` field nor the profile's fields alter this
  contract's canonical form (§2.3).

New extensions are added by registration without altering §2.1, §2.3, or §2.4. An
extension MUST NOT redefine a core field or introduce a second canonicalization.

### 2.3 Canonicalization

Integrity (§2.4) is computed over a **deterministic canonical form** of the
record's protected fields (the core minus `event_hash`, plus the full
`extensions` object). The canonical form is **sorted-key canonical JSON**,
identified as **`audit-record-contract/1`** in the attestation manifest (§2.7). It
is aligned with the canonicalization used by ATSA's clearance assertion (MCP PR
#2809) so that adopters process clearance assertions and audit records on one code
path and one vector matrix. A canonicalization MUST:

- **Sort object keys** lexicographically — in ascending order of their UTF-8
  byte sequences, equivalently Unicode code-point order — at every level,
  including the `extensions` object and each extension's nested data, and
  serialize with no insignificant whitespace. The sort basis is declared rather
  than inherited from a host language's default; on the controlled ASCII
  registry vocabulary (§2.2) every common basis coincides.
- **Canonicalize extensions in the type-keyed object form**
  `extensions:{"<type>":<data>, ...}` — this exact representation is the
  preimage. Implementations MUST NOT substitute an alternative representation
  (e.g. an array of `{type, data}` pairs): different representations of the same
  content produce different digests, and the keyed object is what makes
  one-entry-per-type structurally unrepresentable and rides the same key-sort
  with no special-case rule.
- **Restrict protected values to strings, booleans, and `null`** — each of which
  has exactly one canonical JSON form. **Bare numbers are excluded** from
  protected bodies in this version (`1` vs `1.0` vs `1e0` have no agreed single
  form; a number-canonicalization rule is deferred to a later version — encode
  numeric content as a string in the meantime). `null` is part of the core form
  (every segment head carries `previous_hash: null`); booleans serialize as
  `true`/`false`. An extension MAY adopt a stricter all-strings convention for
  its own data (runtime-security does), but that is the extension's convention,
  not a core rule.
- **Encode null distinguishably from empty string** (`null` vs `""`).
- **Serialize `occurred_at` as RFC 3339 in UTC with millisecond precision and a
  literal `Z`** (the `Date.toISOString()` form, e.g. `2026-06-02T12:00:00.000Z`),
  so timestamp digests are reproducible across implementations regardless of the
  recorder's native timestamp storage.
- **Normalize protected string values** to bound the coupling of integrity to
  free-text fields: Unicode **NFC**, **trim leading/trailing U+0020 (ASCII space)
  only**, reject **control characters**, require **well-formed Unicode** (no
  unpaired surrogate code units), and enforce a **length cap** (baseline 8192
  UTF-16 code units, measured on the normalized value). A protected string
  failing normalization makes the record non-conforming. The trim charset is
  deliberately **U+0020 only**, not the full
  Unicode whitespace class: ASCII space is the only commonly-accidental edge
  whitespace, while non-control Unicode whitespace (NBSP U+00A0, the U+2000–U+200A
  range, ideographic space U+3000, etc.) is preserved as significant content.
  Naming the charset is load-bearing for cross-implementation reproducibility — an
  unqualified "trim" diverges across implementations (SQL `btrim(x, ' ')` strips
  U+0020 only; a typical host `.trim()` strips the full whitespace class). Control
  characters (Unicode category Cc: U+0000–U+001F and U+007F–U+009F) — including
  the C0 set (tab U+0009, LF U+000A, CR U+000D) — are **rejected**, not trimmed;
  a leading or trailing control character renders the record non-conforming
  rather than being stripped. Well-formedness matches the §2.2 element rule: a
  value carrying an unpaired surrogate code unit makes the record non-conforming
  (RFC 8259 §8.2 leaves receiver behavior for unpaired surrogates
  unpredictable — a parser may reject the record, substitute U+FFFD, or pass the
  code unit through, and the latter two silently change the digest).
  **Registry vocabulary is exempt:** extension type ids and registered field
  names are a controlled ASCII registry vocabulary (§2.2) and pass through the
  canonical form verbatim — they are object _keys_, not values, and the registry
  (not normalization) is what constrains them. The exemption is safe precisely
  because the vocabulary is registry-controlled ASCII; an unregistered type id is
  non-conforming under C-REC-1 regardless of its bytes.
- **Escape minimally and encode as UTF-8.** Within a serialized string value,
  escape only `"` as `\"` and `\` as `\\`; every other character, including
  non-ASCII, is serialized literally, never as a `\uXXXX` escape (normalization
  has already rejected every character JSON cannot carry literally). The
  canonical form hashed in §2.4 is the UTF-8 encoding of that serialization.
  This is the same convention the `sources_touched` encoding names (§2.2); left
  unstated, a host JSON serializer that escapes non-ASCII by default produces a
  different preimage — and a different digest — from one that does not, for any
  value outside ASCII.
- **Exclude `event_hash`** (the output) and the reserved `anchor_witness` (§2.8,
  unused in v1) from the canonical body.

The canonical form is identical across extensions; only the data each type id
keys differs. A fixed two-extension known-answer test — one record carrying both
`caller-governance` and `runtime-security`, reproducible from a shell with
`sha256sum` — pins how two extensions hash side by side. (The fixed value, with
its canonical preimage, is given under Conformance; the companion vectors reproduce
it and the full matrix programmatically.)

### 2.4 Integrity Construction (Record Chain)

Records form an append-only **hash chain**. For each record:

- `event_hash` MUST equal `H( canonical_form( protected_body ) )`, where `H` is a
  collision-resistant hash function, `canonical_form` is §2.3, and `protected_body`
  is the core (less `event_hash`) plus the full `extensions` object, and includes
  the record's own `previous_hash`.
- `previous_hash` MUST equal the `event_hash` of the immediately preceding record
  in the chain segment, or null for the first record in a segment.

`H` MUST be SHA-256 at baseline. An implementation MAY use a stronger function;
the function in use MUST be recorded in the attestation manifest (§2.7) so a
verifier is unambiguous (algorithm agility). Implementations MUST NOT use a hash
function with a known practical collision. The digest values carried in the
record (`event_hash`, `previous_hash`) MUST be expressed as **lowercase
hexadecimal**: digest comparison (§2.6) is then exact string equality, and a
digest re-entering the preimage as the next record's `previous_hash` has a
single byte form across implementations.

A chain "segment" is a contiguous run of records over which `previous_hash`
threading is continuous. Implementations MAY segment chains (e.g. per time window
or partition); each segment MUST be independently verifiable and the segmentation
boundary MUST be discoverable to a verifier.

### 2.5 Append-Only Requirement

Once committed to the chain, a record MUST NOT be modified or deleted by any
caller — including a privileged operator — without that alteration being
detectable by the verification procedure (§2.6). Concretely:

- The record store MUST reject in-place UPDATE and DELETE of committed records
  through its normal access paths.
- Any out-of-band alteration (e.g. by a database superuser) MUST change the
  altered record's canonical form and therefore break chain verification at or
  after the altered record.

The _enforcement mechanism_ is implementation-defined and is explicitly NOT
constrained by this specification; it is declared in the attestation manifest (§2.7).
Conforming mechanisms include, and are not limited to: storage-engine permission
revocation plus row-level policy denying mutation; write-once media; an
append-only log service; or a ledger.

### 2.6 Verification Procedure

A conforming chain MUST be verifiable by an independent party in possession of the
records, by the following procedure:

1. For each record, recompute `H( canonical_form( protected_body ) )` and compare
   it to the stored `event_hash`. A mismatch indicates the record was altered
   after commitment (in any protected field, core **or** extension).
2. For each record after the first in a segment, confirm `previous_hash` equals
   the prior record's `event_hash`. A mismatch indicates insertion, deletion, or
   reordering.

The procedure runs identically whether executed by an adopter attesting to its own
trail or by a third party with read access to an exported record set. It MUST be
deterministic: the same record set MUST always produce the same verdict.

### 2.7 Attestation Manifest (Structured Attestation)

The append-only _enforcement_ of §2.5 is a storage property, not a wire-observable
one — so gating it at the protocol surface would be theater. It is therefore
**attested**, but attestation MUST be _structured_: a bare "trust us" claim is not
conformant. A conforming implementation MUST publish a machine-readable
**attestation manifest** declaring:

- `storage_mechanism` — the append-only enforcement mechanism (§2.5).
- `chain_algorithm` — the hash function in use (§2.4).
- `canonical_form_version` — the canonicalization version (§2.3);
  `audit-record-contract/1` for the form defined in this version.
- `verification_procedure_ref` — a resolvable pointer to a reproducible
  implementation of §2.6 that runs over an exported record set and emits a
  deterministic pass/fail verdict.

The machine-checkable vectors (the companion vector set) verify the observable record (schema, extension
validity, canonical form, chain threading, emission). The manifest plus the
referenced verifier make the integrity construction **attested-but-auditable**
rather than attested-in-the-abstract: a reviewer can re-run the declared
verification over the records and reproduce the verdict.

### 2.8 External Anchoring (Reserved; Out of Scope for v1)

Anchoring a chain to an external witness (e.g. RFC 3161 timestamp, version-control
commit, object-store checksum, public ledger) addresses a distinct, weaker-priority
threat — an _auditing organization_ rewriting its own history — that is orthogonal
to the within-system chain construction. Selecting a witness scheme is deferred to
avoid binding v1 to an ecosystem pick.

A field name `anchor_witness` is **reserved** for this purpose. In v1 it MUST be
absent or null and is NOT included in the integrity preimage (§2.3); a follow-on
anchoring extension defines its semantics and whether it enters the preimage.
Anchoring's absence MUST NOT affect conformance to §2.1–§2.7.

### 2.9 Emission Completeness

This specification defines the _record_ and its _construction_, not the policy of which
events a given governance layer must record — that belongs to each referencing
proposal / extension registration. A referencing proposal that adopts this
contract:

- MUST define the set of `event_type` values it requires to be recorded and the
  conditions under which each is emitted;
- MUST record each such event as a conforming record (§2.1–§2.4);
- and the recording of an event MUST NOT fail the governed operation's response
  path solely because record emission failed (audit emission is non-blocking; a
  failed emission MUST itself be detectable, e.g. recorded as an error record or
  surfaced out-of-band).

## Rationale

**Why a separate record contract, rather than audit inside each layer.** Audit is
asserted at several seams (admission, interception/runtime-security,
caller-governance) and given a shared, verifiable definition at none; each names
the guarantee without defining a record shape the others can verify against. What
those layers share is not a field set but a
_construction_ — an append-only, canonically-hashed, chained, independently
verifiable record. Specifying that construction once, with a minimal common core
and a typed extension point per layer, lets all of them conformance-anchor to one
definition without flattening their differences. One well-defined way to solve
the problem, rather than fragmenting audit across N incompatible shapes.

**Key design decisions and alternatives considered.**

- **Type-keyed `extensions` object, not a `{type, data}` array.** The keyed-object
  form makes a duplicate extension type structurally unrepresentable, makes the
  type id a preimage _key_ (so an extension's type cannot be swapped without
  breaking verification), and rides the same every-level key-sort with no
  special-case rule. An array form was rejected: different representations of the
  same content produce different digests, and the array invites duplicate-type and
  ordering ambiguity.
- **Protected values restricted to string / boolean / null; no bare numbers.**
  Each of these has exactly one canonical JSON form. Bare numbers (`1` vs `1.0` vs
  `1e0`) have no agreed single form; rather than bind v1 to a number-canonicalization
  scheme, numeric content is encoded as a string and a number rule is deferred to a
  later canonical-form version. The stricter all-strings convention adopted by the
  runtime-security extension is its own profile choice, not a core rule.
- **Abstract `outcome` enum, not per-layer status codes.** A closed disposition
  vocabulary (`allowed`/`denied`/`deferred`/`error`) keyed on the
  terminal/non-terminal axis stays stable across profiles; domain-specific reason
  codes and severities live in extension data and bind to the base outcome as
  _evidence_, never as a competing outcome. This keeps the cross-profile anchor
  fixed while letting each layer carry its own semantics.
- **Attested-but-structured append-only enforcement, not wire-gating and not
  "trust us".** Append-only _enforcement_ (§2.5) is a storage property, not a
  protocol-observable one; gating it at the wire would be theater. A bare "trust
  us" attestation is non-conformant. The chosen middle path is a machine-readable
  attestation manifest plus a referenced, reproducible verifier that re-runs over
  an exported record set — so a reviewer can reproduce the verdict without the
  guarantee depending on an unobservable claim.
- **The `audit-record-contract/1` form is sorted-key canonical JSON aligned with
  ATSA's clearance assertion (MCP PR #2809), not a new canonicalizer.** Adopters
  process clearance assertions and audit records on one code path and one vector
  matrix; alignment, not a blocking dependency. The form is named and versioned
  here so that a later revision (a number rule, an anchoring hook) is a new
  version, never a silent change.
- **Trim charset is U+0020 only, not the full Unicode whitespace class.** Naming
  the charset is load-bearing for cross-implementation reproducibility: an
  unqualified "trim" diverges (`btrim(x, ' ')` strips ASCII space only; a typical
  host `.trim()` strips the full class). Non-control Unicode whitespace is
  preserved as significant content; control characters are rejected, not trimmed.
- **External anchoring reserved, out of scope for v1.** Anchoring to an external
  witness addresses a distinct, weaker-priority threat and would bind v1 to an
  ecosystem pick; a reserved `anchor_witness` hook leaves the door open without
  committing the core.

**Evidence of process.** The contract was developed in the open in the MCP
Security Interest Group (`#security-ig`) with the author of the admission proposal
(ATSA, MCP PR #2809) and the runtime-security implementer, Syed Maaz Ahmed
(Interlock; MCP PR #2624). The `runtime-security` extension's normative
registration text was contributed by its implementer rather than authored
top-down. The two-extension known-answer digest reproduces byte-for-byte from the
published rule plus stock `sha256sum` across independent implementations — the
cross-implementation agreement the construction is meant to produce (Appendix A
lists the reproductions reported on the public thread).

**On the "make it an extension" question.** A reasonable reading of a protocol's
composability and standardization principles is "build audit on top, as an
extension, rather than in the specification." This contract is positioned as an
_interoperability primitive_ — a canonical byte form that independent
implementations must agree on for cross-vendor verification — not as a protocol
feature or as governance-in-core. The governance semantics ride in registered
extensions, off the core; the only thing standardized is the construction multiple
layers already converge on. Positioned this way, the record contract is the
cross-cutting _evidence_ layer beneath the other proposals: admission (ATSA)
decides whether a server may be used, interception/runtime-security decides
whether an admitted surface drifted, and caller-governance decides whether a caller
may invoke — three different decisions, all three needing the _same_ tamper-evident
record to be accountable. Standardizing that record once is what lets the three
compose without each re-inventing "tamper-evident"; it is the interop seam between
them, not a governance feature competing with any of them.

## Compatibility

This specification is purely additive and constrains nothing outside the record
and its chain.

- **No wire protocol changes.** The contract defines an orthogonal record and its
  verification; it adds no wire messages and no changes to any protocol schema,
  and it does not dictate a database engine, transport, or runtime architecture.
  The record and its verification are off-wire (evaluated over an exported record
  set), so there is no protocol-surface incompatibility. An implementation that
  does not adopt the contract is unaffected.
- **Effect on a referencing specification is opt-in and non-breaking.** A layer
  whose tamper-evident record is a `SHOULD` MAY reference this contract and
  upgrade that obligation to a `MUST` at its own discretion; a layer that states
  tamper-proof audit as a compliance consideration gains a checkable record shape
  without changing its own enforcement. Until a referencing specification chooses
  to upgrade, nothing changes for it. (Appendix A covers the MCP proposals.)
- **Forward-compatible versioning.** Layer-specific context is isolated in the
  type-keyed `extensions` object, so new profiles register without altering the
  core. The canonical-form version is carried in the attestation manifest (§2.7),
  not in the hashed bytes, so a later canonicalization revision (for example, adding
  number canonicalization, or activating the reserved `anchor_witness` hook, §2.8)
  can be introduced as a new canonical-form version without invalidating chains
  produced under an earlier one.
- **Identifier continuity with the SEP-3004 draft.** Under the MCP SEP-3004 draft
  the manifest field carried no pinned value, and the reference implementation
  declared its internal label `gif-audit/2` for the same canonical form (see
  Reference Implementation and Appendix A). A manifest that still declares
  `gif-audit/2` describes the form defined here; a verifier that compares the
  declared value should treat the two identifiers as naming the same form. New
  manifests declare `audit-record-contract/1`.
- **No deprecations.** This specification removes or deprecates nothing.

## Conformance

Conformance is split along what is observable in an exported record set and what
is a storage property that can only be attested (§2.7).

**Machine-checkable (vectors provided).** Given a set of records and a manifest:

- C-REC-1 — every record carries the §2.1 core with conforming types and a
  legal `outcome` disposition (§2.1.1); its `extensions` object carries at least
  one registered type id, no unregistered type ids, and each extension's data
  satisfies its registration's required fields and closed vocabularies.
- C-REC-2 — the canonical form (§2.3) is deterministic, injective over the
  protected body (core **and** extension data), uses the mandated type-keyed
  `extensions` representation, restricts protected values to string/bool/null
  (no bare numbers), normalizes equivalent strings, rejects control characters
  (the full Cc category, C0 and C1) and unpaired surrogate code units while
  accepting well-formed astral code points serialized literally; null encodes
  distinguishably from empty string; registry vocabulary (type ids, registered
  field names) passes through verbatim.
- C-REC-3 — `event_hash` equals the hash of the canonical form of the protected
  body (§2.4), including a fixed known-answer test for cross-implementation
  interop — among them a **two-extension** record pinning how multiple
  extensions hash side by side.
- C-REC-4 — `previous_hash` threading is continuous within a segment; a mutated or
  removed record is detected (§2.6) — including mutation of an extension field such
  as `purpose_declared`.
- C-REC-5 — declared-required `event_type` values are present for a scripted
  sequence of governed events (§2.9).
- C-REC-6 — the extension mechanism is emitter-neutral: records carrying
  different (and multiple) extensions chain under one construction, and extension
  data is integrity-protected by the same chain.
- C-REC-7 — the attestation manifest (§2.7) is structured (declares mechanism,
  algorithm, canonical-form version, and a verification-procedure pointer); a bare
  attestation is non-conformant.

A normative, runnable vector set for C-REC-1…7 is published in this repository
under `vectors/`. `node --experimental-strip-types vectors/run.ts` (Node 22.6 or
later; `npx tsx vectors/run.ts` also works) yields `30 vectors — 30 passed, 0
failed`. Because the integrity guarantee is off-wire (§2.7), these are
record/verifier vectors evaluated over an exported record set — not wire-protocol
scenarios — paired with the structured attestation (§2.7) for the part that is
not observable in the records. The reference implementation carries a verbatim
mirror of the set. String-rule negatives re-seal the mutated record with the
verifier's own canonicalizer before verifying, so the only ground for rejection
is the rule under test; a verifier that lacks the rule accepts the record and
fails the vector.

**Two-extension known-answer test (self-contained).** The cross-implementation
interop anchor referenced in C-REC-3 is fixed here so it can be reproduced with no
repository and no dependence on any implementation — a single segment-head record
(`previous_hash: null`) carrying both registered extensions, pinning how two
extensions hash side by side under one digest. The identifiers are vendor-neutral
constants; `event_hash` is the computed output and is excluded from the preimage.

The canonical form (§2.3) of the protected body is the exact byte string:

```
{"event_id":"99999999-9999-9999-9999-999999999999","event_type":"tool_call","extensions":{"caller-governance":{"flagged":false,"invoked_by_principal_id":null,"purpose_declared":"reconcile June invoices","session_id":"55555555-5555-5555-5555-555555555555"},"runtime-security":{"drift_status":"confirmed","evidence_hash":"sha256:b2c547e2c8f17eafc72ef5c2d4d7b6b4d0f7437ab52bae573a9af14ff5e2d9be","policy_id":"example.org/runtime-drift@3","quarantine_decision":"quarantine","severity":"high"}},"occurred_at":"2026-06-06T12:00:00.000Z","outcome":"deferred","previous_hash":null,"principal_id":"aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa","tool_name":"export"}
```

whose SHA-256 is:

```
f733fed9cc757165f810b778e4baba1f51a45504988e937707aaab4361b2f064
```

Reproduce from any shell — paste the preimage block above between the quotes:

```
printf '%s' '<canonical preimage above>' | sha256sum
# -> f733fed9cc757165f810b778e4baba1f51a45504988e937707aaab4361b2f064
```

Because the digest is a property of the canonical bytes alone, any implementation
adopting §2.3 lands on the same value. The published vector set additionally pins
the single-extension `caller-governance` digest (`d494769c…`) and the full
C-REC-1…7 matrix.

**Attested-but-structured (not protocol-observable).** The append-only
_enforcement_ of §2.5 is attested via §2.7. A conformance harness verifies the
_consequence_ (chain verification fails after an out-of-band mutation, C-REC-4)
and the _structure_ of the attestation (C-REC-7), rather than the storage
mechanism itself.

## Open Items

(The design decisions resolved during review — extension representation,
canonical form, the outcome vocabulary, value types, and the
attested-but-structured verification surface — are recorded in the Rationale's
"Key design decisions and alternatives considered.")

- **Q-A — Normative registration text for `admission-control`.** The
  `runtime-security` registration was contributed by its implementer and is folded
  into §2.2; `admission-control` remains contributed by reference (ATSA, MCP PR
  #2809). This specification fixes the mechanism and the `caller-governance`
  extension.
- **Q-B — Anchoring extension.** Semantics of the reserved `anchor_witness`
  (§2.8), deferred to a follow-on canonical-form version.
- **Q-C — Number canonicalization.** Bare numbers are excluded from protected
  bodies in `audit-record-contract/1` (§2.3); a number rule, if adopted, is a new
  canonical-form version.

## Security Implications

A hash chain provides tamper-_evidence_, not tamper-_prevention_: it guarantees
that alteration of committed records is _detectable_, not impossible. Detection
depends on at least one trustworthy copy of a prior `event_hash` — the motivation
for the reserved external-anchor hook (§2.8) against adversaries who can reach the
record store. Because `purpose_declared` and other extension fields are inside the
chain (§2.2), the privileged-actor-rewrites-intent vector is closed: altering a
recorded reason breaks verification. The integrity guarantee is only as strong as
the protected field set; fields an extension registration chooses to leave out of
its data object are unprotected. Timestamps are recorder-assigned (§2.1) to
prevent a governed
caller from backdating records. String normalization (§2.3) bounds — but does not
eliminate — the risk of homoglyph/encoding ambiguity in free-text fields; it does
not address confidentiality of record contents, which may carry sensitive
governance context and SHOULD be access-controlled independently of integrity
protection. A verifier processing records from an untrusted source SHOULD bound
canonicalization (§2.3) recursion depth: deeply-nested input is otherwise a
stack-exhaustion vector, and conforming records are shallow, so a generous cap
rejects only hostile input (the reference verifier caps depth accordingly).

## Privacy Considerations (informative)

The chain protects the bytes of every protected field (§2.3), so a protected value that
carries personal data cannot be altered or removed later without the record failing
verification (§2.6, C-REC-4). This contract defines no accepted-break or redaction
mechanism: a record whose protected bytes were rewritten, for any reason, is a detected
mutation. Implementations subject to an erasure duty (for example GDPR Article 17) therefore
keep personal data out of the protected bytes rather than planning to remove it from them.

Three patterns satisfy this without any change to the contract:

- **Pseudonymous identifiers.** `principal_id`, `invoked_by_principal_id`, and
  `human_actor_id` are opaque identifiers; the mapping to a natural person lives outside
  the record under access control. Free-text fields such as `purpose_declared` carry the
  declared purpose, not the data the action touched.
- **Ciphertext values.** A value that must carry personal data is stored as ciphertext under
  a key scoped to the data subject; the ciphertext string is what is canonicalized and
  hashed. Destroying the key erases the data while the chain stays verifiable.
- **Off-record commitments.** The protected field carries a salted digest or an opaque
  reference to a value held off-record; deleting the off-record value erases the data while
  the commitment, and the chain, remain intact. An extension MAY declare which of its fields
  are commitments so that consumers do not read them as content.

The record carries no tool-call payloads. An extension that commits to request or response
bytes follows the same pattern: the digest is protected, and the bytes themselves are held
off-record under their own access and retention policy.

Retention, export, and the identification of records that contain personal data are
implementation obligations outside this contract (§2.9 and Compatibility). Regimes that
require immutable retention of audit records and regimes that require erasure of personal
data are satisfied by the same arrangement: personal data outside the protected bytes,
integrity inside them.

## Reference Implementation

An open-source reference implementation of this construction exists: the Governed
Intelligence Framework (Apache 2.0, `https://github.com/notboatanchor/gif`). It
implements the **core + chain construction + the `caller-governance` context**.
Its canonical form matches this contract's rule (the `audit-record-contract/1`
form: sorted-key JSON, millisecond RFC 3339 timestamps, `purpose_declared` in the
preimage). It implements this contract's `extensions` keyed-object shape (its
internal label for the form is `canon_version = gif-audit/2`, migration 015; the
predecessor single-profile shape `gif-audit/1` merged in gif PR #28) and mirrors
`vectors/` verbatim under `mcp-server/conformance/audit-record-contract/`. Its audit
trigger emits and reproduces the **single-extension** `caller-governance`
known-answer digest (`d494769c…`) as its own self-test; the **two-extension**
digest (`f733fed9…`, given under Conformance) is reproduced by the same canonical
rule over the published preimage — and exercised synthetically in the conformance
vectors — rather than minted by the live trigger. This is consistent with the
digest being a property of the canonical bytes, not of any one implementation: a
second implementer (the runtime-security implementation, MCP PR #2624)
independently reproduced it from the rule alone, and three further parties
reported clean-room reproductions on the public thread (Appendix A). It produces caller-bound,
append-only, SHA-256 hash-chained audit records; enforces append-only at the
storage layer via privilege revocation plus row-level policy and a trusted hashing
trigger; and ships runnable conformance scenarios for record emission, append-only
behavior, and scope-gated read. Per the spec-vs-source discipline, the reference
implementation does strictly more than this contract requires (it binds records to
a persona/session governance model and a scope system not specified here), and the
contract is written to admit implementation paths other than the reference one
(storage engine, enforcement mechanism, and every extension beyond
caller-governance are open).

Independent implementations of the **same construction** under other extensions
exist — a runtime-security receipt (MCP PR #2624) and an admission record (ATSA,
MCP PR #2809) — which is the intended outcome: the construction is the
invariant, the extension is the variation, and multiple implementation paths
anchor to one definition.

## Acknowledgments

This contract was developed in the open in the MCP Security Interest Group
(`#security-ig`) as SEP-3004. The `admission-control` extension is named by
reference to the Attested Tool-Server Admission proposal (ATSA, MCP PR #2809). The
`runtime-security` registration text was contributed by its implementer
(Interlock). Independent reproductions of the known-answer digests, and the
adversarial and cross-implementation vectors offered on the public thread, are
what a byte contract exists to invite.

## Appendix A — Origin and the MCP profile (informative)

**A.1 Origin.** The contract was drafted from 2026-06-02 in the MCP Security
Interest Group, filed as SEP-3004 (PR #3004) on 2026-07-02, and reviewed there
in public (55 comments). On 2026-09-22 the MCP maintainers closed fifteen SEP
pull requests in one pass, this one among them, with an identical note asking
that new proposals be developed in a working group first; the close carried no
content verdict. The normative text at the PR's final commit
(`9405ba2f`) is carried here with three kinds of change only: the SEP framing
(status, sponsor, process references) is removed; the canonical form is named
(`audit-record-contract/1`, §2.3 and §2.7); and the vector set is extended from 23
to 26 to cover rules the text already stated (C-REC-2: C1 controls, unpaired
surrogates, literal astral characters). No rule in §2.1–§2.9 changed. Both
known-answer digests are unchanged. Version 1.0.0 adds four rejecting vectors
(C-REC-3 and C-REC-5), for 30 in total, and one dated sentence in §2.2; no rule
and no digest changed.

**A.2 How MCP layers reference the contract.** The contract is off-wire, so an
MCP proposal references it the way it references RFC 8785 or RFC 3339: by URL and
version, without owning it.

- _ATSA (PR #2809)_ registers the `admission-control` extension (§2.2) in its own
  text and points its audit conformance at this contract's canonical form and
  vectors.
- _Interceptors / runtime security (PR #2624)_ states tamper-proof audit as a
  compliance consideration; this contract supplies the checkable record shape.
  The `runtime-security` extension (§2.2) is that layer's registration.
- _Caller governance_ is the worked extension (`caller-governance`, §2.2); the
  reference implementation is a caller-governance layer.
- _Runtime-evidence layers_ that verify live wire bytes (a different preimage from
  the durable record) compose with this contract by carrying their digest as
  registered extension data, and may anchor their at-rest record to this contract
  by reference rather than defining a second chain construction.

**A.3 Conformance under SEP-2484.** An MCP proposal that references this contract
satisfies the machine-checkable half of SEP-2484's Final gate with the C-REC-1…7
vectors, evaluated over an exported record set, and the documented-exclusion half
with the §2.7 attestation manifest for append-only enforcement, which is not
wire-observable.

**A.4 Citing this contract.** Cite the repository URL with a release tag, and the
canonical form by its identifier: "audit records conform to the Tamper-Evident
Audit Record Contract v1.0.0, canonical form `audit-record-contract/1`." A
referencing document that needs a different canonical form is describing a
different contract and MUST NOT reuse the identifier.

**A.5 Independent reproductions reported on the SEP-3004 thread (2026-07 to
2026-09).** Clean-room reproductions of both known-answer digests from the text
alone were reported by three parties independent of the authors, one of them
also publishing a harness that runs the reference verifier as a library over a
foreign export, and cross-implementation divergence findings were reported
against the C-REC matrix. These are the thread's reports, not claims
verified by the authors; the KAT digests themselves are reproducible by anyone
from the Conformance section.
